a.)Flight Delay Prediction Model for 49-781 course.We did pairs , linear regression , logistic regression & Random Forest Modeling for our flight delay prediction model.
b.) We also made a shiny app to show causal relationship between different delay reasons.Using our shiny app, we are sharing the hourly/weekly/monthly flight delay trends.
1.) FlightPrediction.R - R script for pairs & linear regression modeling
2.) DA_Project.R - R script for multi-variate logistic regression 
3.) RandomForest.R - R script for random forest prediction model
4.) App - Shiny App . It includes server.r & ui.r & www subdirectory.
